### Hi there 👋

I'm **Emir Belkahia** — Staff Customer Success Manager at Algolia.

**Day job:** Strategic accounts at Algolia — making sure search works so well customers actually want to stay.

**Side quest:** Hunt down friction, automate it away. AI turned "I wish I could fix this" into "fixed in 20 minutes." Now I just can't stop — every irritating workflow is a target.

**What I've shipped:** Chrome extensions, Voice AI workflows, n8n automations, LLM analytics tools, Python scripts. Claude Skills are life.

**I write about:** Customer Success, systems thinking, and automation on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sharpcustomersuccess).

**My stack:** Mac · VS Code + Claude Code · Python · n8n
